\section{Serializability \& Locking}
The predecence graph for Schedule 1 can be seen in figure \ref{fig:schedule1}.
As there is a cycle the schedule is not conflict-serializable. The schedule
could not have been generated using strict two-phase locking as the write to X
in T2 needs to happen after the read in T1. T1 cannot be completed and thus
releasing the lock of X as T3 needs to release the read lock for Y. T3 cannot
run before T2 which is visible in the predence graph. 

\input{figures/schedule1}

Figure \ref{fig:schedule2} show the precedence graph for Schedule 2. There is no
cycle which means it is conflict serializable. Figure \ref{fig:schedule2-2pl}
shows injected read/write locks in accordance with strict 2PL rules.
